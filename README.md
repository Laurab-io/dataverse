# dataverse

<p>Dataverse uses JavaScript to explore concepts like space and time in a very simplistic and representitive way.</p>

It should be an interesting exercise for basic and intermediate programmers to explore how we can use simple programming concepts to build a simple model of a universe. This 3D space could be used for games, data storage, etc.

<p>This script illustrates the use of functions, classes, objects and prototypes as well as callback functions, arrays and other basic programming concepts.</p>

<p>USAGE: The main logic can be found in js/script.js</p>
